                Spain has long been known for being a two or three-club league, which is a factor that may have hurt them a little bit as the difference between the top three leagues was minimal.

                <br><br> Another thing that stands out about Ukrainian football is that their teams do put up a good showing in Europe as represented by their 12 wins on the continental level this season.
                <br><br> While Shakhtar Donetsk did not star in the UEFA Champions League, Chornomorets Odesa, Dynamo Kyiv and Dnipro all finished second in their respective groups in the UEFA Europa League.

                The domestic league with the highest point differential that we examined was the Brasileirao.
                <br><br> An eye-popping 56 points was the difference between 2013 winners Cruziero and 20th-place finishers Nautico.
                <br><br> Despite the lack of parity at the domestic level, Brazilian clubs did work wonders at the 2013 Copa Libertadores with five clubs reaching the knockout phase.
                <br><br> Of those five clubs, Atletico Mineiro ended up as the South American champion with Fluminense being the only other side reaching the quarterfinals.
                <br><br> While they did have a successful group campaign at the continental level, Brazil's best clubs not named Atletico Mineiro could not get the job done when it mattered most.

                Look away now, fans of Serie A, as your favorite league is down in ninth place on this list.
                <br><br> The two main reasons for the Italian top flight ranking this low are the high amount of red cards and massive gulf in class from top to bottom in the table.
                <br><br> Out of all the leagues examined, Serie A had the worst red card rate with 52 total ejections across 380 games in the 2013-14 campaign.
                <br><br> Coincidence or not, the league with the highest red card percentage was also one of the worst in terms of point differential.
                <br><br> Out of the top European leagues, the 39 points currently separating Juventus and Catania was the one of the worst.
                <br><br> Luckily, a few other leagues across the pond in North and South America beat the Italians to the title of highest point differential.
                <br><br> Regardless, Serie A's lack of discipline hurt them in a massive way as the momentum in numerous games was shifted because of red cards.

                There are so many statistics that you can choose from nowadays to decipher whether a league is good or not.
                <br><br> Instead of making a deep dive into how many successful tackles or aerial duels were won by each team in each league, we decided to look at some of the stats that matter most.
                <br><br> The four statistics looked at for this ranking were goals per games played, red cards per games played, continental victories and point differential from first to last.
                <br><br> Goals bring the entertainment factor to world football and there is no denying that they are the ultimate game-changer. For this list, the number of goals scored were divided by the total number of games played in each league.
                <br><br> Red cards were selected to see how disciplined a certain league is. As we all know, red cards can shift matches on their head, which meant whatever league had the most red cards per games played was at a disadvantage.
                <br><br> Continental wins were used to determine how great the clubs in one domestic league were against top clubs from other leagues, while point differential measured the amount of parity in a single league as it counted the difference
                in points from first to last in the league table.

                <br><br> The difference between second and third was marginal, but the Bundesliga did beat out La Liga on a few statistics.
                <br><br> Right away, the first stat that the Bundesliga has a strong advantage in is goals per game, a number that is not held down by the bottom half of the table in Germany.
                <br><br> All but three clubs in Germany have scored over 20 goals this season. The three teams that have failed to score that many are all in the relegation zone.
                <br><br> At the European level, the Germans may have two fewer wins than the Spanish, but they also have one less team in the two continental competitions.
                <br><br> Red cards were selected to see how disciplined a certain league is. As we all know, red cards can shift matches on their head, which meant whatever league had the most red cards per games played was at a disadvantage.
